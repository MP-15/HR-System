# Human Activity Recognition using Smart watch data analysis
Under this project student can recognize the human activities based on the dataset (available online & Manual) and classify them. Further, based on this classification, suggestions can be shared to the user to improve the lifestyle for better health.


**Human Activity Recognition**

Human activity recognition is a broad field of study concerned with identifying the specific movement or action of a person based on sensor data. Movements are often typical activities performed indoors, such as walking, talking, standing, and sitting. The sensor data may be remotely recorded, such as video, radar, or other wireless methods. Alternately, data may be recorded directly on the subject such as by carrying custom hardware or smart phones that have accelerometers and gyroscopes.
Sensor data for activity recognition was challenging and expensive to collect, requiring custom hardware. Now smart phones and other personal tracking devices used for fitness and health monitoring are cheap and ubiquitous. As such, sensor data from these devices is cheaper to collect, more common, and therefore is a more commonly studied version of the general activity recognition problem. The problem is to predict the activity given a snapshot of sensor data, typically data from one or a small number of sensor types.
